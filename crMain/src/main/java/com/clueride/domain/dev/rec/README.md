** Package com.clueride.domain.dev.rec **

Classes in this package represent the guts of a NetworkProposal for amending
the Network.

Although the name of the package is simply 'rec', the classes and interfaces
within this package have been prepared for the New Location functionality.  It
would probably be more appropriate to call the package loc.rec or rec.loc, but
until we have something other than loc, let's go with this.
