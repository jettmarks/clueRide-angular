## Package com.clueride.io 

Classes in this package provided a couple of services:

- Writing JSON to a file-based "database"
- Providing JSON to return in response to a web-client call.
 
For Data Store features, the `com.clueride.dao` package provides 
a layer of abstraction for reading and persisting.
