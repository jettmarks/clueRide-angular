    You'll find the cycling community encourages watching out
    for each other.  You can do your part by being prepared for
    emergencies.

    Most common problem is a flat tire.  Carrying a spare tube and tools
    for changing a flat will likely avoid having to walk to a bike shop.
    If you need a bike shop, consult

    Call 911.  Your map location will help responders find you.
    <p>
    If you have CPR training or first aid skills, not only would your
    group be appreciative in an emergency, but others that we encounter
    may also benefit.
    <H3>Awareness</H3>
    Riding in a group is the best insurance that you'll have built-in
    help when you need it, but do your part by looking out for hazards
    and alerting your group.  Cyclists pose little threat and are
    rarely threatened, but a call to 911 can summon help if needed.
    <p>
    Keeping Safety in mind allows for the best experience for everyone.
    Thanks for being on the lookout for situations that may endanger us.
