Clue Ride Game Module
====
This module presents the single-page application that Clue Ride Players run. 
There are multiple modes this supports depending on 

- The capabilities of the player (Profile)
- The capabilities of the device (mobile / GPS)
- Whether the player is at home, joining a team or riding solo.
- Badges earned (particularly significant for team leaders and course developers)
- The choice of Course to play.

This document covers many of these choices and how they affect the play.

Introductions to Clue Ride
====
There are two good ways to introduce yourself to Clue Ride: 

1. Take the arm-chair tour.
2. Join a Team with an experienced leader.

These are the shortest paths to become familiar with how the game is played.

Three Modes of Play
====

Mode | Description 
-----|-------------
Arm-chair | Sit at your desk and watch your progress on a map.  
Team | Either drum up a team and find a leader, or join a team as an invitee of the leader.
Solo | Run the course on your own.

These are described in more detail below.

Arm-chair
----
_This is also called "demo" mode._

If you're unable to ride because of weather, or no bike, or can't find anyone to join you -- whatever the reason,
you can still enjoy Clue Ride. 

Team
----
Most people participating in Clue Ride will join a team with an experienced Team Leader. 
_How to become a Team Leader_ is something we'll come to later.

Solo
----
A good way to become familiar with a course so you can lead a group is to ride the course solo. This way you can learn 
course and scope out any hazards that may be present along the way. This option is more of a 
labor of love than it is entertainment.

Capabilities Required for the Modes of Play
----

Capability    | Arm-chair | Team | Solo
--------------|-----------|------|-----
Working Bike  | -         | Y    | Y   
Mobile Phone  | -         | -    | Y
Internet Data | Y         | -    | Y
GPS phone     | -         | -    | Y (for full experience)

A few points to make: 

- Although Team Members don't require a phone, some one on the team (preferably the Team Leader) will have
a connection to the game over the internet to view the course maps, read the clues, view the locations, and answer the
questions that allows the team to progress.
- Again, although Team Members don't require a phone with data and GPS, they can follow along
easier and answer the clues themselves instead of depending on the Team Leader.
- Solo is essentially practicing to be a Team Leader.

Player Profile
====
Players self-select their level based on an assessment of their cycling ability. The web page 
[Tell us about yourself](https://www.clueride.com/index.php/tell-us-about-yourself/) describes the levels and helps riders self-select their level.
